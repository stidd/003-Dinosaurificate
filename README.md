On line 1 we've got a new thing. A var short for variable. It's a place to store some information like numbers, letters, lists, points, anything you've ever seen in a video game, even this text you're reading now... they all can be stored in variables. Variables are the place to put your nouns while functions are like the verbs you use. Anyway, that's a variable called firstName that is being set to the value of "Mike" a string of characters.

Now look on line 2. Both firstName and "osauraus" are strings. See how you can concatenate (meaning join together) strings with the + sign. Hit run and check it out.

Write a function called dinosaurificate that takes as a parameter a person's name as a string and returns that name with "osaurus" concatenated onto the end of it.
